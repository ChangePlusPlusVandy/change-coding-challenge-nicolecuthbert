Pretty much the entirety of this project was built using things that I taught myself in the past couple of days. If I had more time, I would have made a better user interface, possibly using something like React to make it more polished and deployable than the Python GUI I used. I'm sure there are some bugs that I could iron out as well.

I authenticated the Twitter API using a bearer token kept in a separate file. I can edit my code to include it if that would be better for you.

EDIT: bearer token in tokens.txt file

If for whatever reason the project does not work as intended, I included a video of what it should be.
